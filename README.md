# 5G-NR

My Bachelor thesis on "Comprehensive analysis of 5G NR: Overview of the Physical Layer, Network Security, and its vulnerabilities to Jamming Attacks" with Supervisor Professor
Mrs. Anna Tzanakaki.

**Abstract**
5G is the fifth generation of wireless cellular networks and enables new use cases, such as high user mobility and connectivity of a huge number of devices to the network, while also promising higher data rates, lower latency, and enhanced reliability. At the same time, 5G made improvements in the security and privacy aspects over 4G and predecessors. However, the 5G standard is not without any security vulnerabilities. In fact, the security threat landscape of 5G is expanding due to the increased types of services 5G offers and the large number of devices the network supports.
The objective of this thesis is the study of security issues in 5G, emphasizing on the 5G NR physical (PHY) layer and its vulnerabilities to jamming attacks. The thesis includes an overview of the 5G network and its security weaknesses, 5G NR and the 5G core network and an analysis of the 5G NR PHY layer. Moreover, the thesis explores the different types of jamming attacks and examines mitigation techniques that can make the PHY layer more resilient to attacks in the next generation of wireless networks.
